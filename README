OVERVIEW OF x2tv
==================================

The x2tv provides an interface for a user, with a usb-tv-stick to watch tv.

The directories within this package:

* doc
  Documentation.
* etc
  A sample configuration file for libsensors, and a script to convert
  lm-sensors version 2 configuration files to work with version 3.
* lib
  The user-space sensors support library code (libsensors).
* prog
  Several supporting programs. The most important ones are:
  - sensors-detect: A stand-alone program for detecting installed
    hardware and recommending specific modules to load.
  - sensors: A console tool to report sensor readings and set new
    sensor limits.
  - sensord: A daemon to watch sensor values and log problems. It
    includes RRD support.
* configs
  This directory contains sample configurations of various boards,
  contributed by users of lm-sensors.

  Older sample configurations can be found on an old lm-sensors wiki
  archived here:

  Please contribute back a configuration of your board so other users with
  the same hardware won't need to recreate it again and again.
